Twitter to Slack Forwarder
==========================

This bot provides a bridge between Twitter and your favourite Slack channel.

In the example messages are posted into the #general channel, but you will probably want to create a dedicated channel that people can opt/in 
out of. Bear in mind that you could also do processing on the Tweeet before forwarding it - or even filter out unwanted/wanted material.

* Sign up for Slack bot account and access token
* Insert token, channel and bot-name in the config.json file
* Run app.js with Node.js or start a Docker container. The first argument is the hashtag to follow.


You can also sign up for your own (free) Slack community such as alexellis.slack.com so that you don't need to bother your regular team with 
your hacking. For instance if you follow the Docker or Raspberry Pi tweet your phone will be buzzing all day.
